# 261. Graph Valid Tree

## What constitutes a ğŸŒ²
1. it's a graph.
2. Connected: edges == n - 1, visited node count == n
3. Acyclic: there is no cycle.

## Approach A. DFS
use DFS to check if there is a cycle in the graph.
- if there were no cycle & visited node count == n, return True.

## Approach B. Disjoint Set Union (ì„œë¡œì†Œ ì§‘í•©)
use Disjoint Set Union to check if there is a cycle in the graph.
- if you find a cycle, return False immediately.
- if you find no cycle, return True.

### Union Find Operation
- Find: find the root of a node.
  - if the root of two nodes is already the same, there is a cycle.
- Union: connect two nodes. 

## Approach Comparison
- **A. DFS**: simple and easy to understand.
- **B. Disjoint Set Union**: quicker to check if there is a cycle. if there were more edges, Union Find would be faster.
